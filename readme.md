In this project i have done Exploratory data analysis in detail.

### Algorithms used 
* Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) classifier basically implements a plain SGD learning routine supporting various loss functions and penalties for classification. Scikit-learn provides SGDClassifier module to implement SGD classification(Source Scikit-learn).
